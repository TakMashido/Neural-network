marge error and weights calculation to one mmethod(optymalization)
add dynamic n and m for each layer(baseN/connectionNumber, baseM/connectionNumber)
check if making kerel for each layer can speed up(one time set up parameters)
add validational set
add ability to choose device we want to run network at(for now device 0 in platform 0).
add removing low weights and low weights-neurons to optymalize network structure (good start to evolution-backpropagation algoritm)
